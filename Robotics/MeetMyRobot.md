## Introduction

Space is a dangerous place and human life is too important to risk it.
That's why we are using where is it possible for space exploration.
Robots can take dangerous and routine work and they are really helpful.

Robots are not Sci-Fi already and we meet them more and more often
in our life. You can buy a robot or make it yourself.

So let's talk about robots. Your robots.

## Problem

Some people still think about robots as about something fantastic and futuristic. For some people, robots are commonness and they don't wonder by it. Some of the people afraid robots. Some of you construct and program robots.

Let's talk about robots. Robots are interesting and we should tell about it, everybody.

Tell about YOUR robot. It can be bought from a geek shop or maybe your constructed it yourself. Maybe your team develops the new generation of robots. Tell about it and your experience. Tell why is it interesting.

## Output

Write a short story about your robot (any if you have several).
How you get it. What is the special in your robot?
Is it interesting and why if yes.

##### Optional
Add video link and show your robot (you can use video story instead writing).

Add photos or schemas of your robot.

Any additional links if you think it's important (maybe a link to an open source repository with schemas and code).
