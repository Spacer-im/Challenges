### Introduction

The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)
is the collective name for scientific activities undertaken to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life.
And one of these activities is ATA.

The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a Radio Interferometer that is dedicated to astronomical and simultaneous search for extra-terrestrial intelligence observations. It's construction was a joint effort by the SETI Institute and the UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory (RAL) with major funding from Paul Allen.

ATA collected the big set of data and this data should be processed and examined.
[SETI@Home](http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) is a scientific experiment that uses Internet-connected computers in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). You can participate by running a free program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data.

### Problem

So anyone can participate in the space exploration just by running the screensaver.
But maybe it should be an application or a web service, where people can openely participate.

The [Setiquest](http://setiquest.org/) data archive contains 4 TB of quadrature waveform samples of interesting targets that have been collected at the Allen Telescope Array.
With this data we can build more interesting applications or services,
where anyone can contribute their CPU power and see results of their contribution,
not just data about consumed CPU/GPU power.

Or we can build software where people can help process ATA data, like the closed [SetiLive](http://www.setilive.org/).

Propose and describe a service or a product that can be built with SETI data. It can be a website with visualization of SETI data. Or it can be a data mining project. The only restriction is your imagination.

If you have coding skills and want to challenge yourself even more, you can make something interesting with SETI data and maybe we will find tracks of intelligent extraterrestrial life.
