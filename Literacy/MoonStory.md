### Introduction (Background)

For me, the passion to outer space and high technologies began neither from the lessons of astronomy
 nor from my college. The first interest for cosmos appeared from books. Sci-Fi books.
I read them a lot. And after reading the several of them,
I started to learn mathematics, engineering, and other sciences because I would like to be closer
for all things that I saw in books.

Popularization of the space theme is an important task and
your writing skills can be no less important than engineering or physical expertise.

### Problem

Colonization of the Moon has been excited spacer long ago.
Let's dream about it but in Sci-Fi style.

Write a short story about a moon colony (or colonies).
It's preferable if the story will be science fiction but, if you want, you can write in other genres.

### Output

A short story. Add illustrations if you want.
